## Description
SMS(Science Made Simple) is a programming language meant for people interested in Science and Mathematics. It aims to simplify the workload by having built-in functions that take care of common, and sometimes even uncommon, formulas and procedures. It has a simple syntax that makes it easy for anyone to grasp quickly.
 
## Motivation
The most popular programming languages ​​have functions of an internal library of the mathematics class developed for the language, but none of them has a library in which a developer can solve different science problems together in a direct way.

It is inspired by MATLAB in the sense that it concentrates on Mathematics and Science. It will include functions for mathematical problems such as integral, derivatives, etc. It will also include sciences like chemistry and physics.

We are engineering students who attended many math and science classes. We want to help future students go through those classes and it also serves as a review of what we have learned over the years.
